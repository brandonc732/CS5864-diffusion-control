Repository for CS5864 final project about controlling stable diffusion generation bias by manipulating the U-Net model's attention mechanisms

**Text Self-Attention Maps (T-SAM)**

Focuses on aligning the attention matrices between the CLIP encoder and U-Net diffuser with cosine similarity.

The GitHub they provide shows how they construct their custom Stable Diffusion 1.5 pipeline with the ability to change its attention matrices at given diffusion steps. This will probably be our main source for laying out our model.

**Bias-Map**

Just released a new paper in September that seems very close to our project. Will have to read through it.
