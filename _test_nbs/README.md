# Overview

This folder will hold all testing files and stuff. I prefer to work in jupyter lab notebooks for ease of use

## Colab use

Virginia Tech google accounts won't let you lauch a drive file with colab, so you'll have to create an empty file directly from the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) webpage.

Then you can clone the repository and copy any notebook cells from here into your working notebook.

This is really dumb, but seems to be the only way with Virginia Tech Google Colab.
